I am a fourth-year Astronomy PhD student at Northwestern University, advised by [Fred Rasio](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/rasio/). My research focuses on the dynamics of dense star clusters. In particular, I simulate globular clusters with the Cluster Monte Carlo code (CMC), and study the formation, evolution and dynamics of pulsars in clusters.
